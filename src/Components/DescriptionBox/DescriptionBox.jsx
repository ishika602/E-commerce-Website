            <p>E commerce is the process of buying and selling goods and services online. It has become increasingly popular in recent years, as it offers a convenient and efficient way to shop. There are many advantages to using e commerce, including the ability to compare prices, access a wider range of products, and enjoy greater convenience. It is also typically faster and more convenient than traditional shopping methods.</p>
            <p>Customers can shop at any time of day or night from the comfort of their own homes. They donâ€™t have to deal with traffic, crowds, or weather. Second, e-commerce often offers lower prices than traditional stores because businesses save on overhead costs like rent, utilities, and employees. Finally, customers can usually find a wider selection of goods and services online than they can in a physical store.</p>
